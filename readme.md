Hello, I created an application that takes in a user's current location and then passes those coordinates into 2 APIs to get weather information and timezone. For this project. I used vanilla JavaScript, bootstrap, and some CSS. 

The API websites:
https://timezonedb.com/api
https://openweathermap.org/
